		<div class="ingredients">
				<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>1 medium yellow or white onion, chopped</li>
					<li>2 carrots, peeled and chopped</li>
					<li>4 garlic cloves, pressed or minced</li>
					<li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
					<li>1 large can (28 ounces) diced tomatoes, lightly drained</li>
					<li>1 cup brown or green lentils, picked over and rinsed</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon chipotle powder or smoked hot paprika</li>
					<li>1 cup chopped fresh collard greens or kale, tough ribs removed</li>
					<li>1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice (½ to 1 medium lemon), to taste</li>
				</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="instructions">
				<h2>Instructions:</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Warm the olive oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat.
						One-fourth cup olive oil may seem like a lot, but it adds a lovely
						richness and heartiness to this nutritious soup.</li>
					<li>Once the oil is shimmering, add the chopped onion and carrot and
						cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is turning
						translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
					<li>Add the garlic, cumin, curry powder and thyme. Cook until
						fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds. Pour in the
						drained diced tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring
						often, in order to enhance their flavor.</li>
					<li>Pour in the lentils, broth and the water. Add 1 teaspoon salt
						and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Season generously with freshly
						ground black pepper. Raise heat and bring the mixture to a boil,
						then partially cover the pot and reduce the heat to maintain a
						gentle simmer. Cook for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the lentils are
						tender but still hold their shape.</li>
				  <li>Transfer 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Securely fasten the
						lid, protect your hand from steam with a tea towel placed over the
						lid, and purée the soup until smooth. Pour the puréed soup back
						into the pot. (Or, use an immersion blender to blend a portion of
						the soup.)</li>
				  <li>Add the chopped greens and cook for 5 more minutes, or until the
						greens have softened to your liking. Remove the pot from the heat
						and stir in 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Taste and season with
						more salt, pepper and/or lemon juice until the flavors really sing.
						For spicier soup, add another pinch or two of red pepper flakes.</li>
